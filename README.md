# MonsterSlayerVuePractice
Monster Slayer was an early project in a vue course on Udemy by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. This project was the most fun in my opinion. Having completed the course, I wanted to practice all of the concepts I have learned. I will be doing that by trying to turn this simple beginner project into something kind of awesome.
