# monster-slayer

### Project Overview
Monster Slayer was a beginner project in a VueJS course on Udemy by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. This project was one of my favorites from the course. Having finished the course, I want to practice what I have learned. I hope to do that by turning this beginner project into something kind of awesome.
